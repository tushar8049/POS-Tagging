Develop a hidden Markov Model for part-of-speech
(POS) tagging, using a modified Brown corpus as training data. To simplify
the problem, we will use a tagset which is composed of 11 tags. i.e. Noun, Pronoun, Verb, Adjective, Adverb, Conjunction, Preposition, Determiner, Number,
Punctuation and Other.
