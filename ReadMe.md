<h1> Part Of Speech - Tagging (POS-Tagging)</h1>
Develop a hidden Markov Model for part-of-speech
(POS) tagging, using a modified Brown corpus as training data. To simplify
the problem, we will use a tag-set which is composed of 11 tags. i.e. Noun, Pronoun, Verb, Adjective, Adverb, Conjunction, Preposition, Determiner, Number,
Punctuation and Other.


The corpus for this can be downloaded from this link:

Your goal is to design and implement a class ‘Tagger’ that is able to tag the
following sentences:

1. The Secretariat is expected to race tomorrow .
2. People continue to enquire the reason for the race for outer space .
