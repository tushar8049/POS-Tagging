If/CONJUNCTION we/PRONOUN are/VERB discussing/VERB differentiable/ADJECTIVE complex-valued/ADJECTIVE functions/NOUN ,/PUNCT then/ADJECTIVE Af/NOUN and/CONJUNCTION V/NOUN are/VERB complex/ADJECTIVE vector/NOUN spaces/NOUN ,/PUNCT and/CONJUNCTION Af/NOUN may/VERB be/VERB any/DETERMINER complex/ADJECTIVE numbers/NOUN ./PUNCT 
We/PRONOUN now/ADVERB write/VERB Af/NOUN where/ADVERB Af/NOUN are/VERB distinct/ADJECTIVE complex/ADJECTIVE numbers/NOUN ./PUNCT 
If/CONJUNCTION Af/NOUN is/VERB the/DETERMINER null/ADJECTIVE space/NOUN of/PREPOSITION Af/NOUN ,/PUNCT then/ADVERB Theorem/NOUN 12/NUMBER says/VERB that/CONJUNCTION Af/NOUN ./PUNCT 
In/PREPOSITION other/DETERMINER words/NOUN ,/PUNCT if/CONJUNCTION F/NOUN satisfies/VERB the/DETERMINER differential/ADJECTIVE equation/NOUN Af/NOUN ,/PUNCT then/ADVERB F/NOUN is/VERB uniquely/ADVERB expressible/ADJECTIVE in/PREPOSITION the/DETERMINER form/NOUN Af/NOUN where/ADVERB Af/NOUN satisfies/VERB the/DETERMINER differential/ADJECTIVE equation/NOUN Af/NOUN ./PUNCT 
Thus/ADVERB ,/PUNCT the/DETERMINER study/NOUN of/PREPOSITION the/DETERMINER solutions/NOUN to/PREPOSITION the/DETERMINER equation/NOUN Af/NOUN is/VERB reduced/VERB to/PREPOSITION the/DETERMINER study/NOUN of/PREPOSITION the/DETERMINER space/NOUN of/PREPOSITION solutions/NOUN of/PREPOSITION a/DETERMINER differential/ADJECTIVE equation/NOUN of/PREPOSITION the/DETERMINER form/NOUN Af/NOUN ./PUNCT 
This/DETERMINER reduction/NOUN has/VERB been/VERB accomplished/VERB by/PREPOSITION the/DETERMINER general/ADJECTIVE methods/NOUN of/PREPOSITION linear/ADJECTIVE algebra/NOUN ,/PUNCT i.e./ADVERB ,/PUNCT by/PREPOSITION the/DETERMINER primary/ADJECTIVE decomposition/NOUN theorem/NOUN ./PUNCT 


To/X describe/VERB the/DETERMINER space/NOUN of/PREPOSITION solutions/NOUN to/PREPOSITION Af/NOUN ,/PUNCT one/PRONOUN must/VERB know/VERB something/PRONOUN about/PREPOSITION differential/ADJECTIVE equations/NOUN ;/PUNCT ;/PUNCT 
that/DETERMINER is/VERB ,/PUNCT one/PRONOUN must/VERB know/VERB something/PRONOUN about/PREPOSITION D/NOUN other/DETERMINER than/CONJUNCTION the/DETERMINER fact/NOUN that/CONJUNCTION it/PRONOUN is/VERB a/DETERMINER linear/ADJECTIVE operator/NOUN ./PUNCT 
However/ADVERB ,/PUNCT one/PRONOUN does/VERB not/PUNCT need/VERB to/X know/VERB very/ADVERB much/DETERMINER ./PUNCT 
It/PRONOUN is/VERB very/ADVERB easy/ADJECTIVE to/X establish/VERB by/PREPOSITION induction/NOUN on/PREPOSITION R/NOUN that/CONJUNCTION if/CONJUNCTION F/NOUN is/VERB in/PREPOSITION Af/NOUN then/ADVERB Af/NOUN ;/PUNCT ;/PUNCT 
that/DETERMINER is/VERB ,/PUNCT Af/NOUN ,/PUNCT etc./ADVERB ./PUNCT 
Thus/ADVERB Af/NOUN if/CONJUNCTION and/CONJUNCTION only/ADVERB if/CONJUNCTION Af/NOUN ./PUNCT 
A/DETERMINER function/NOUN G/NOUN such/ADJECTIVE that/CONJUNCTION Af/NOUN ,/PUNCT i.e./ADVERB ,/PUNCT Af/NOUN ,/PUNCT must/VERB be/VERB a/DETERMINER polynomial/ADJECTIVE function/NOUN of/PREPOSITION degree/NOUN Af/NOUN or/CONJUNCTION less/DETERMINER :/X Af/NOUN ./PUNCT 
Thus/ADVERB F/NOUN satisfies/VERB Af/NOUN if/CONJUNCTION and/CONJUNCTION only/ADVERB if/CONJUNCTION F/NOUN has/VERB the/DETERMINER form/NOUN Af/NOUN ./PUNCT 
Accordingly/ADVERB ,/PUNCT the/DETERMINER '/PUNCT functions/NOUN '/PUNCT Af/NOUN span/VERB the/DETERMINER space/NOUN of/PREPOSITION solutions/NOUN of/PREPOSITION Af/NOUN ./PUNCT 
Since/CONJUNCTION Af/NOUN are/VERB linearly/ADVERB independent/ADJECTIVE functions/NOUN and/CONJUNCTION the/DETERMINER exponential/ADJECTIVE function/NOUN has/VERB no/DETERMINER zeros/NOUN ,/PUNCT these/DETERMINER R/NOUN functions/NOUN Af/NOUN ,/PUNCT form/VERB a/DETERMINER basis/NOUN for/PREPOSITION the/DETERMINER space/NOUN of/PREPOSITION solutions/NOUN ./PUNCT
