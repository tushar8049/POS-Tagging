that/DETERMINER is/VERB a/DETERMINER figure/NOUN one/NUMBER with/PREPOSITION 27/NUMBER ciphers/NOUN ,/PUNCT quite/X a/DETERMINER large/ADJECTIVE number/NOUN ./PUNCT 
Then/ADVERB I/PRONOUN calculated/VERB that/CONJUNCTION a/DETERMINER million/NUMBER peas/NOUN would/VERB just/ADVERB about/ADVERB fill/VERB a/DETERMINER household/NOUN refrigerator/NOUN ;/PUNCT ;/PUNCT

I/PRONOUN saw/VERB that/CONJUNCTION I/PRONOUN would/VERB soon/ADVERB run/VERB out/ADVERB of/PREPOSITION buildings/NOUN at/PREPOSITION this/DETERMINER rate/NOUN ,/PUNCT so/CONJUNCTION I/PRONOUN decided/VERB to/X take/VERB another/DETERMINER measure/NOUN --/PUNCT the/DETERMINER whole/ADJECTIVE state/NOUN of/PREPOSITION Pennsylvania/NOUN ./PUNCT

You/PRONOUN can/VERB imagine/VERB what/DETERMINER it/PRONOUN would/VERB look/VERB like/CONJUNCTION going/VERB out/ADVERB on/PREPOSITION the/DETERMINER turnpike/NOUN with/PREPOSITION the/DETERMINER peas/NOUN banked/VERB up/ADVERB against/PREPOSITION the/DETERMINER houses/NOUN and/CONJUNCTION covering/VERB the/DETERMINER cars/NOUN ;/PUNCT ;/PUNCT 
Pennsylvania/NOUN thus/ADVERB blanketed/VERB would/VERB contain/VERB about/ADVERB a/DETERMINER quintillion/NUMBER peas/NOUN ./PUNCT 


But/CONJUNCTION we/PRONOUN still/ADVERB have/VERB a/DETERMINER long/ADJECTIVE way/NOUN to/X go/VERB ./PUNCT 
Next/ADVERB we/PRONOUN imagine/VERB our/PRONOUN blizzard/NOUN raging/VERB over/PREPOSITION all/X the/DETERMINER land/NOUN areas/NOUN of/PREPOSITION the/DETERMINER entire/ADJECTIVE globe/NOUN --/PUNCT North/ADJECTIVE America/NOUN ,/PUNCT South/ADJECTIVE America/NOUN ,/PUNCT Europe/NOUN ,/PUNCT Asia/NOUN ,/PUNCT and/CONJUNCTION Africa/NOUN ,/PUNCT all/ADVERB covered/VERB with/PREPOSITION peas/NOUN four/NUMBER feet/NOUN deep/ADJECTIVE ;/PUNCT ;/PUNCT

Next/ADVERB we/PRONOUN freeze/VERB over/ADVERB the/DETERMINER oceans/NOUN and/CONJUNCTION cover/VERB the/DETERMINER whole/ADJECTIVE earth/NOUN with/PREPOSITION peas/NOUN ,/PUNCT then/ADVERB we/PRONOUN go/VERB out/ADVERB among/PREPOSITION the/DETERMINER neighboring/VERB stars/NOUN ,/PUNCT collect/VERB 250/NUMBER planets/NOUN each/DETERMINER the/DETERMINER size/NOUN of/PREPOSITION the/DETERMINER earth/NOUN ,/PUNCT and/CONJUNCTION also/ADVERB cover/VERB each/DETERMINER of/PREPOSITION these/DETERMINER with/PREPOSITION peas/NOUN four/NUMBER feet/NOUN deep/ADJECTIVE ;/PUNCT ;/PUNCT 
and/CONJUNCTION then/ADVERB we/PRONOUN have/VERB septillion/NUMBER ./PUNCT 
Finally/ADVERB we/PRONOUN go/VERB into/PREPOSITION the/DETERMINER farthest/ADJECTIVE reaches/NOUN of/PREPOSITION the/DETERMINER Milky/ADJECTIVE Way/NOUN ;/PUNCT ;/PUNCT 
we/PRONOUN get/VERB 250,000/NUMBER planets/NOUN ;/PUNCT ;/PUNCT 
we/PRONOUN cover/VERB each/DETERMINER of/PREPOSITION these/DETERMINER with/PREPOSITION our/PRONOUN blanket/NOUN of/PREPOSITION peas/NOUN and/CONJUNCTION then/ADVERB at/PREPOSITION last/ADVERB we/PRONOUN have/VERB octillion/NUMBER peas/NOUN corresponding/VERB in/PREPOSITION number/NOUN to/PREPOSITION the/DETERMINER atoms/NOUN in/PREPOSITION the/DETERMINER body/NOUN ./PUNCT
