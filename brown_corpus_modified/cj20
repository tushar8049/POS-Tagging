The/DETERMINER arc/NOUN is/VERB itself/PRONOUN a/DETERMINER segment/NOUN of/PREPOSITION an/DETERMINER analytic/ADJECTIVE curve/NOUN ./PUNCT

The/DETERMINER values/NOUN Af/NOUN are/VERB the/DETERMINER ordinary/ADJECTIVE values/NOUN at/PREPOSITION Af/NOUN of/PREPOSITION a/DETERMINER multi-valued/ADJECTIVE function/NOUN g{t}/NOUN which/DETERMINER has/VERB components/NOUN corresponding/VERB to/PREPOSITION those/DETERMINER of/PREPOSITION f{t}/NOUN ./PUNCT 
Proof/NOUN ./PUNCT 

We/PRONOUN first/ADVERB define/VERB a/DETERMINER function/NOUN b{t}/NOUN as/CONJUNCTION follows/VERB :/X given/VERB the/DETERMINER set/NOUN of/PREPOSITION squares/NOUN such/ADJECTIVE that/CONJUNCTION each/DETERMINER has/VERB three/NUMBER corners/NOUN on/PREPOSITION C/NOUN and/CONJUNCTION vertex/NOUN at/PREPOSITION t/NOUN ,/PUNCT b{t}/NOUN is/VERB the/DETERMINER corresponding/ADJECTIVE set/NOUN of/PREPOSITION positive/ADJECTIVE parametric/ADJECTIVE differences/NOUN between/PREPOSITION T/NOUN and/CONJUNCTION the/DETERMINER backward/ADJECTIVE corner/NOUN points/NOUN ./PUNCT 
The/DETERMINER functions/NOUN F/NOUN and/CONJUNCTION B/NOUN have/VERB exactly/ADVERB the/DETERMINER same/DETERMINER multiplicity/NOUN at/PREPOSITION every/DETERMINER argument/NOUN T/NOUN ./PUNCT 
Now/ADVERB with/PREPOSITION P/NOUN fixed/VERB at/PREPOSITION Af/NOUN ,/PUNCT Af-values/NOUN occur/VERB when/ADVERB the/DETERMINER corner/NOUN Af/NOUN crosses/VERB C/NOUN ,/PUNCT and/CONJUNCTION are/VERB among/PREPOSITION the/DETERMINER values/NOUN of/PREPOSITION S/NOUN such/ADJECTIVE that/CONJUNCTION Af/NOUN ./PUNCT 
The/DETERMINER roots/NOUN of/PREPOSITION this/DETERMINER equation/NOUN are/VERB just/ADVERB the/DETERMINER ordinates/NOUN of/PREPOSITION the/DETERMINER intersections/NOUN of/PREPOSITION the/DETERMINER graph/NOUN of/PREPOSITION B/NOUN with/PREPOSITION a/DETERMINER straight/ADJECTIVE line/NOUN of/PREPOSITION unit/NOUN slope/NOUN through/PREPOSITION Af/NOUN in/PREPOSITION the/DETERMINER b-plane/NOUN (/PUNCT the/DETERMINER plane/NOUN of/PREPOSITION the/DETERMINER graph/NOUN of/PREPOSITION b/NOUN )/PUNCT ./PUNCT 
We/PRONOUN define/VERB these/DETERMINER values/NOUN as/CONJUNCTION Af/NOUN ,/PUNCT and/CONJUNCTION define/VERB g{t}/NOUN in/PREPOSITION the/DETERMINER same/DETERMINER way/NOUN for/PREPOSITION each/DETERMINER T/NOUN ./PUNCT 
Thus/ADVERB we/PRONOUN obtain/VERB g{t}/NOUN by/PREPOSITION introducing/VERB an/DETERMINER oblique/ADJECTIVE g{t}-axis/NOUN in/PREPOSITION the/DETERMINER Aj/NOUN ./PUNCT
